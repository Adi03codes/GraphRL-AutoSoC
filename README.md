# GraphRL-AutoSoC
AI-Optimized Automotive System-on-Chip using Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Edge IoT and Multimodal AI


Project Description

GraphRL-AutoSoC is a research-oriented digital-twin framework that integrates AI-driven VLSI optimization, multimodal driver sensing, cloud-free IoT deployment, and generative-AI based design verification into a unified system for next-generation intelligent automotive platforms.

The project models a complete automotive safety-critical SoC that:

Receives IMU and camera data from drivers,

Processes them on an energy-optimized AI-designed hardware architecture,

Is deployed across a self-hosted IoT edge network, and

Is verified using large language models and graph-based reasoning.

This work is motivated by the need for low-power, reliable, and explainable AI hardware for autonomous and driver-assist systems.


Research Objectives

This project aims to:

Optimize VLSI design using AI

Use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model SoC netlists as graphs.

Use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize placement, routing, and power.

Deploy intelligence on cloud-free IoT edge

Create a local, self-hosted sensor network using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.

Evaluate protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, TCP and UDP for real-time reliability.

Fuse IMU and vision for driver behavior

Classify driving style (safe, aggressive, distracted, drowsy) using:

Video CNNs

IMU-based LSTMs

Multimodal fusion networks

Verify safety using Generative AI

Parse automotive control diagrams and logic

Convert them into graphs

Use LLMs to detect inconsistencies, missing links, and unsafe sequences
